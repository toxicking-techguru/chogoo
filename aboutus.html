			<h2> ABOUT US </h2>
			<p> Agnes is the coordinator of Chongoo Tree Nursery and its parent group, Cheptengis Okilgei Group. Her
				group is the umbrella body for all the 38 tree nursery initiatives in Elgeyo Marakwet County. Of the 38
				groups, 7 are youth groups while the remaining 31 are women groups with an average population of 20
				members per group.Her motivation for founding Cheptengis Okilgei Group was to conserve water catchment
				areas. Being a farmer, she was deeply concerned by the degradation of Cherangany Forest as it would
				affect the rainfall patterns and ultimately crop yields.

            <h3 style="color: purple;">History</h3>
            <p>The group conducts tree nursery set up trainings, community empowerment and creates employment
                for the locals that manage the nurseries. The youths have been encouraged to forgo alcoholism
                and dedicate themselves to tree planting as an economic activity. The group’s activities are
                funded by donors such as World Vision (under the Regreening Africa Programme) and the County
                government. Once grown, the trees are sold to partners such as Equity Bank and WWF. Net Fund
                recently donated 500,000 planting tubes to Chogoo Tree Nursery to aid in expanding their
                production capacity.

                The group’s activities have afforded the women members an opportunity to be self sustaining. The
                group donated 20,000 seedlings in September 2021 to the youth in Elgeyo Marakwet to plant in
                their homes as part of their CSR. The trees donated were Cypress and Grevillea.

                Their primary challenge is the cultural constraints that hinder women from benefiting
                financially from selling their trees as the trees always belong to the men. However, this is
                slowly improving as women take up more leadership positions in the tree nursery groups.</p>

			<h1 style="color: red;"> OUR AIM</h1>
			<p>1. Reducing Climate Change

				If people are good at something, then it is building up excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Harmful
				CO2 contributes to climate change, the biggest current problem the world has to deal with. Trees,
				however, help fight it. They absorb CO2 removing it from the air and storing it while releasing oxygen.
				Annually, an acre of trees absorbs the amount of carbon dioxide equal to driving your car 26 000 miles.
				Trees are our main survival tools; only one tree can produce enough oxygen for four people.</p>
